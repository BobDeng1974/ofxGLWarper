OFXGLWARPER

openGL based image warper add-on
Based on the openGL image warper example by Theo Watson.

-Warp anything that's being drawn in OF.
-begin() and end() methods to define the warpped elements.
-Easy quad manipulation by draging the quad corners with the mouse.
-A method to get the screen to warpped image coordinates.
-Setup now requires the resolution of the screen to be passed making it much more flexible.
